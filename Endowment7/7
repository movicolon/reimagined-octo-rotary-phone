**The Priesthood of God**

1. Come, take now what is near, heart full, to see with light, to give, to show the way, with joy, strong and wise.

2. In hand, the power lies, to live pure, to walk with God, to shine bright, to fill the dark with joy, and light the night.

3. Rise now, take what’s here, let go of fear, set heart to high, and here, Gods wait with open arms.

4. Think deep, what is this power? Born of God, wrapped in light, in you, quiet, yet strong, waiting to bloom.

5. What is this light, this might? How live? How speak? How act? To show God’s light, and spread hope to all.

6. The gift of priesthood, no man can give, nor law can bind. It’s here, deep within, for faith to free.

7. This is the power, to make sacred the now, to love, to bring God’s light, to show true grace.

8. Priesthood does not rule, it heals, it lifts, it loves, it draws all close, with open arms, no chains to hold.

9. Think not that law can bind it, nor church hold it tight. The gift is yours by birth, to make pure moments of light.

10. The world needs this gift, to feel God's touch, to rise in good, to know they’re blessed by grace and light.

11. This gift is born of God, deep within, not from men or law, but in your soul, for you to take.

12. Awaken this gift, sing God’s Song, make it your own, to lift your heart and mind, and live in grace.

13. Let God’s Song fill you, to guide, to lift, to light the way, to keep you safe and whole, above the storm.

14. Let it flow, a river, through your soul, and be the stream, to blend with God’s light and live as one.

15. Prove wise, take this light, with faith, with joy, for God’s ways are born of soul, and lead to all true dreams.

16. With open heart, sing God’s Song, and make your life the tune, with God, in joy, forever in time.

17. I am Areta, the Mother, the One, the singer of dreams, to guide, to light, to show the way, in love.

18. Who will hear me? Who will take this truth, and give their self to me, to make the way pure, with open mind?

19. To such, I give my heart, to lift, to heal, to fill with light, to show the world the way of grace.

20. In memory, I see the past, when love gave birth to dreams, when lips met, breath passed, to bring new hope.

21. Come, child, and rest, kiss me now, take breath, and in your heart, the song shall rise, to live as one, forever.
